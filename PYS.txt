1.1 Now, the teachings of yoga
1.2 Yoga is to still the patterning of consciousness 
1.3 Then, pure awareness can abide in its very nature
1.4 Otherwise, awareness takes itself to be the patterns of consciousness
1.5 There are five types of patterns, including both hurtful and benign
1.6 They are right perception, misperception, conceptualization, deep sleep, and remembering
1.7 Right perception arises from direct observation, inference, or the words of others
1.8 Misperception is false knowledge, not based on what actually is
1.9 Conceptualization derives from linguistic knowledge, not contact with real things
1.10 Deep sleep is a pattern grounded in the perception that nothing exists
1.11 Remembering is the retention of experiences
1.12 Both practice and non-reaction are required to still the patterning of consciousness
1.13 Practice is the sustained effort to rest in that stillness
1.14 And this practice becomes firmly rooted when it is cultivated skillfully and continuously for a long time
1.15 As for non-reaction, one can recognize that it has been fully achieved when no attachment arises in regard to anything at all, whether perceived directly or learned
1.16 When the ultimate level of non-reaction has been reached, pure awareness can clearly see itself as independent from the fundamental qualities of nature
1.17 At first, the stilling process is accompanied by four kinds of cognition: analytical thinking, insight, bliss, or feeling like a self
1.18 Later, after one practices steadily to bring all thought to a standstill, these four kinds of cognition fall away, leaving only a store of latent impressions in the depth memory
1.19 Once the body is gone, and these latent impressions are dissolved in nature, they are inclined to be reborn
1.20 For all others, faith, energy, mindfulness, integration, and wisdom form the path to realization
1.21 For those who seek liberation wholeheartedly, realization is near
1.22 How near depends on whether the practice is mild, moderate, or intense
1.23 Realization may also come if one is oriented toward the ideal of pure awareness, Isvara
1.24 Isvara is a distinct, incorruptible form of pure awareness, utterly independent of cause and effect, and lacking any store of latent impressions
1.25 Its independence makes this awareness an incomparable source of omniscience
1.26 Existing beyond time, Isvara was also the ideal of the ancients
1.27 Isvara is represented by a sound, om
1.28 Through repetition its meaning becomes clear
1.29 Then, interiorization develops and obstacles fall away
1.30 Sickness, apathy, doubt, carelessness, laziness, hedonism, delusion, lack of progress, and inconstancy are all distractions which, by stirring up consciousness, act as barriers to stillness
1.31 When they do, one may experience distress, depression, or the inability to maintain steadiness of posture or breathing
1.32 One can subdue these distractions by working with any one of the following principles of practice
1.33 Consciousness settles as one radiates friendliness, compassion, delight, and equanimity toward all things, whether pleasant or painful, good or bad
1.34 Or by pausing after breath flows in or out
1.35 Or by steadily observing as new sensations materialize
1.36 Or when experiencing thoughts that are luminous and free of sorrow
1.37 Or by focusing on things that do not inspire attachment
1.38 Or by reflecting on insights culled from sleep and dreaming
1.39 Or through meditative absorption in any desired object
1.40 One can become fully absorbed in any object, whether vast or infinitesimal
1.41 As the patterning of consciousness subsides, a transparent way of seeing, called coalescence, saturates consciousness; like a jewel, it reflects equally whatever lies before it - whether subject, object, or act of perceiving
1.42 So long as conceptual or linguistic knowledge pervades this transparency, it is called coalescence with thought
1.43 At the next stage, called coalescence beyond thought, objects cease to be colored by memory; now formless, only their essential nature shines forth
1.44 In the same way, coalesced contemplation of subtle objects is described as reflective or reflection-free
1.45 Subtle objects can be traced back to their origin in undifferentiated nature
1.46 These four kinds of coalescence - with thought, beyond thought, reflective, reflection-free - are called integration that bears seeds of latent impressions
1.47 In the lucidity of coalesced, reflection-free contemplation, the nature of the self becomes clear
1.48 The wisdom that arises in that lucidity is unerring
1.49 Unlike insights acquired through inference or teachings, this wisdom has as its object the actual distinction between pure awareness and consciousness
1.50 It generates latent impressions that prevent the activation of other impressions
1.51 When even these cease to arise, and the patterning of consciousness is completely stilled, integration bears no further seeds
2.1 Yogic action has three components - discipline, self-study, and orientation toward the ideal of pure awareness
2.2 Its purposes are to disarm the causes of suffering and achieve integration
2.3 The causes of suffering are not seeing things as they are, the sense of ‘I’, attachment, aversion, and clinging to life
2.4 Not seeing things as they are is the field where the other causes of suffering germinate, whether dormant, activated, intercepted, or weakened
2.5 Lacking this wisdom, one mistakes that which is impermanent, impure, distressing, or empty of self for permanence, purity, happiness, and self
2.6 The sense of ‘I’ ascribes selfhood to pure awareness by identifying it with the senses
2.7 Attachment is a residue of pleasant experience
2.8 Aversion is a residue of suffering
2.9 Clinging to life is instinctive and self-perpetuating, even for the wise
2.10 In their subtle form, these causes of suffering are subdued by seeing where they come from
2.11 In their gross form, as patterns of consciousness, they are subdued through meditative absorption
2.12 The causes of suffering are the root source of actions; each action deposits latent impressions deep in the mind, to be activated and experienced later in this birth, or lie hidden awaiting a future one
2.13 So long as this root source exists, its contents will ripen into a birth, a life, and experience
2.14 This life will be marked by delight or anguish, in proportion to those good or bad actions that created its store of latent impressions
2.15 The wise see suffering in all experience, whether from the anguish of impermanence, or from latent impressions laden with suffering, or from incessant conflict as the fundamental qualities of nature vie for ascendancy
2.16 But suffering that has not yet arisen can be prevented
2.17 The preventible cause of all this suffering is the apparent indivisibility of pure awareness and what it regards
2.18 What awareness regards, namely the phenomenal world, embodies the qualities of luminosity, activity, and inertia; it includes oneself, composed of both elements and the senses; and, it is the ground for both sensual experience and liberation
2.19 All orders of being - undifferentiated, differentiated, indistinct, distinct - are manifestations of the fundamental qualities of nature
2.20 Pure awareness is just seeing, itself; although pure, it usually appears to operate through the perceiving mind
2.21 In essence, the phenomenal world exists to reveal this truth
2.22 Once that happens, the phenomenal world no longer appears as such; it continues to exist as a common reality for everyone else, though
2.23 It is by virtue of the apparent indivisibility of the phenomenal world and pure awareness that the former seems to possess the latter’s powers
2.24 Not seeing things as they are is the cause of this phenomenon
2.25 With realization, the appearance of indivisibility vanishes, revealing that awareness is free and untouched by phenomena
2.26 The apparent indivisibility of seeing and the seen can be eradicated by cultivating uninterrupted discrimination between awareness and what it regards
2.27 At the ultimate level of discrimination, wisdom extends to all seven aspects of nature
2.28 When the components of yoga are practiced, impurities dwindle; then, the light of understanding can shine forth, illuminating the way to discriminative awareness
2.29 The eight components of yoga are external discipline, internal discipline, posture, breath regulation, concentration, meditative absorption, and integration
2.30 The five external disciplines are not harming, truthfulness, not stealing, celibacy, and not being acquisitive
2.31 These universals, transcending birth, place, era, or circumstance, constitute the great vow of yoga
2.32 The five internal disciplines are bodily purification, contentment, intensity, self-study, and orientation toward the ideal of pure awareness
2.33 Unwholesome thoughts can be neutralized by cultivating wholesome ones
2.34 We ourselves may act upon unwholesome thoughts, such as wanting to harm someone, or we may cause or condone them in others; unwholesome thoughts may arise from greed, anger, or delusion; they may be mild, moderate, or extreme; but they never cease to ripen into ignorance and suffering. This is why one must cultivate wholesome thoughts.
2.35 Being firmly grounded in non-violence creates an atmosphere in which others can let go of their hostility
2.36 For those grounded in truthfulness, every action and its consequences are imbued with truth
2.37 For those who have no inclination to steal, the truly precious is at hand
2.38 The chaste acquire vitality
2.39 Freedom from wanting unlocks the real purpose of existence
2.40 With bodily purification, one’s body ceases to be compelling, likewise contact with others
2.41 Purification also brings about clarity, happiness, concentration, mastery of the senses, and capacity for self-awareness
2.42 Contentment brings unsurpassed joy
2.43 As intense discipline burns up impurities, the body and its senses become supremely refined
2.44 Self-study deepens communion with one’s personal deity
2.45 Through orientation toward the ideal of pure awareness, one can achieve integration
2.46 The postures of meditation should embody steadiness and ease
2.47 This occurs as all effort relaxes and coalescence arises, revealing that the body and the infinite universe are indivisible
2.48 Then, one is no longer disturbed by the play of opposites
2.49 With effort relaxing, the flow of inhalation and exhalation can be brought to a standstill; this is called breath regulation
2.50 As the movement patterns of each breath - inhalation, exhalation, lull - are observed as to duration, number, and area of focus, breath becomes spacious and subtle
2.51 As realization dawns, the distinction between breathing in and out falls away
2.52 Then the veil lifts from the mind’s luminosity
2.53 And the mind’s potential for concentration is realized
2.54 When consciousness interiorizes by uncoupling from external objects, the senses do likewise; this is called withdrawal of the senses
2.55 Then the senses reside utterly in the service of realization
